## Key Features

**Dashboard Overview**

Get a snapshot of your productivity: overdue tasks, upcoming deadlines, and overall progress all at a glance. With the AI Daily Planner, you can get a prioritized and motivational schedule for your day with a single click.

**AI-Powered Goal Decomposition**

Don't just manage projects; create them with purpose. Give the AI Goal Planner a high-level goal like "Learn web development," and it will intelligently break it down into a structured plan with multiple sub-projects and all the necessary tasks, neatly organized in your sidebar.

**Hierarchical Project Management**

Track everything from courses and conferences to personal projects. Projects can be created manually or generated by the AI as part of a larger goal. Each project gets its own page with a dynamic progress bar that updates as you complete tasks.

**Task Management**

Break down projects into actionable steps. Set priorities (High, Medium, Low), assign due dates, and check off completed tasks with ease.

**Advanced AI-Powered Planning (Gemini API Integrated)**

ProdHub uses the Google Gemini API for smart, context-aware planning:

- **Goal Decomposition:** Turns your big ambitions into actionable projects. And with Ai gemerated pre tasks for better understanding.

- **Daily Planning:** Creates a prioritized daily schedule based on your tasks and calendar.

  - Smart Scheduling: The "Plan My Day" button on the dashboard will trigger an AI that acts as a productivity coach. It will analyze overdue tasks, today's high-priority items, and your fixed Google Calendar appointments.

  - Actionable Output: Instead of just a list, the AI will generate a suggested schedule with time blocks and priorities. It will be presented in a clean, easy-to-read modal. For example, it might suggest: "9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Focus on 'Draft Project Proposal' (Overdue Task)" and then slot other tasks around your scheduled meetings.

  - Context-Aware: If you haven't synced your calendar, the planner will still work with your tasks but will also gently remind you that connecting your calendar can lead to even better plans.

- **Task Generation:** Generates intelligent task lists for your projects, using your project title and synced Google Calendar events for context.

**Habit Tracker:** Build better routines with a full-featured habit tracker. Set daily habits, check them off, and track your consistency and streaks over time. You can easily edit or delete habits as your goals evolve.

**Unified Schedule:** See all your project deadlines, task due dates (including overdue items), and Google Calendar events beautifully organized in one timeline - no more switching between apps.

**Secure Calendar Integration:** Sync your Google Calendar securely and privately. ProdHub only reads event information to help you plan and never stores or modifies your calendar data. Your data stays yours.

<!--**Persistent, Private Data:**

Everything you add is saved in real-time to your secure, private Firebase account. Your information is always up-to-date and accessible wherever you are.

**Safe Sign-In:**

Log in with Google or a traditional email and password. ProdHub prioritizes your privacy and security every step of the way.-->
